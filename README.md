=========

[**KeLP**][kelp-site] is the Kernel-based Learning Platform developed in the [Semantic Analytics Group][sag-site] of
the [University of Roma Tor Vergata][uniroma2-site].

This is the online-large-margin module of KeLP. 
It contains online learning algorithms for both classification and regression tasks. The following algorithms are currently implemented:

**CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS:**

* _LinearPassiveAggressiveClassification_: linear version of the Passive Aggressive learning algorithm for classification (Crammer '06) 
* _KernelizedPassiveAggressiveClassification_: kernel-based version of the Passive Aggressive learning algorithm for classification (Crammer '06)
* _LinearPerceptron_: linear version of the Perceptron learning algorithm for classification (Rosenblatt '57)
* _KernelizedPerceptron_: kernel-based version of the Perceptron learning algorithm for classification (Rosenblatt '57)
* _RandomizedBudgetPerceptron_: an extention of the Randomized Budget Perceptron proposed in (Cavallanti '06)

**REGRESSION ALGORITHMS:**

* _LinearPassiveAggressiveRegression_: linear version of the Passive Aggressive learning algorithm for regression (Crammer '06)
* _KernelizedPassiveAggressiveRegression_: kernel-based version of the Passive Aggressive learning algorithm for regression (Crammer '06)

**META-LEARNING ALGORITHMS:**

* _MultiEpochLearning_: a meta algorithm for performing multiple iterations on a training data
* _Stoptron_: an extention of the Stoptron algorithm proposed in (Orabona '08)
